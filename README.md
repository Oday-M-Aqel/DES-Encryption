# DES Encryption Project  

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š  
Welcome to my **DES Encryption Project**. This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** encryption algorithm using **C#** with a GUI interface.  

## Overview  

In this project, Iâ€™ve implemented a simplified DES encryption process. It includes:  
- Conversion of plain text into binary.  
- Binary splitting and swapping operations.  
- Using S-Boxes to process data.  
- XOR operations for data manipulation.  
- Initial and final permutations for encryption.  

The graphical interface makes it easier to interact with the encryption process and see how it works step by step!

## Features  

1. **Binary Conversion**: Converts text into binary for encryption.  
2. **Permutation**: Applies initial permutation for reordering bits.  
3. **Splitting & Swapping**: Splits the binary data and swaps the parts.  
4. **Expansion and Substitution**: Processes the binary data through S-Boxes.  
5. **Key Manipulation**: Rotates keys and applies them in the encryption process.  
6. **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface to visualize encryption.

## How to Use  

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.  
2. Run the application.  
3. Enter text into the input box for encryption.  
4. Press the **Encrypt** button to see the magic happen! ðŸŽ‰  
5. The encrypted text will be displayed in the output section.

## Project Structure  

- **Form1.cs**: The main code file containing the encryption logic and GUI functionality.  
- **S-Boxes**: Predefined substitution boxes used in the DES algorithm.  
- **Helper Methods**: Functions for binary manipulation, permutation, and other operations.  

---

## Technologies Used  

- **C#**: Programming language.  
- **Windows Forms**: For creating the GUI.

## Notes  

- This project simplifies DES for educational purposes and is not intended for real-world encryption.  
- If you face any issues, feel free to tweak the code and experiment. Learning is fun! ðŸ˜Š

## About Me  

My name is **Oday Aqel**, and Iâ€™m a fresh graduate in Applied Computing. I created this project to understand encryption better and showcase my skills.

## Future Improvements  

I plan to:  
- Add decryption functionality.  
- Make the GUI even more interactive.  
- Implement more encryption algorithms.
